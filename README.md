# Bootcamp Challenge Week Nine - Node js - Professional Readme Generator
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


## Description

The purpose of this application is to test my knowledge of Node JS, by prompting the user for information about their project and then generating a professional README.md file.

This application saves the user time in producing a readme file.

During this project I learnt how to create links and dynamic iamges within the markdown language, while also improving my knowledge of the inquirer package.
