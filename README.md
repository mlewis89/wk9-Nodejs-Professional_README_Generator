[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


## Description

The purpose of this application is to test my knowledge of Node JS, by prompting the user for information about their project and then generating a professional README.md file.

This application saves the user time in producing a readme file.

During this project i learnt how to the inquirer package while also improving my knowledge of the markdown language, including how to create a table of contents and a licence badge
